I developed a lottery application with web3 where users send a certain amount of ether and register, and the ether accumulated in the pool is randomly selected as a winner and transferred to that address. While doing this project, I used javascript's react and web3 libraries, and I used Bootstrap for the front-end design. The source codes of the project are in the file.
